# Audits from Matter Labs

Welcome to the repository of Matter Labs Audit Reports! 

Our mission is to support the community and ecosystem by providing thorough and transparent security audits. 
We aim to enhance the sanity, safety, and stability of decentralized applications built on zkSync.

## Goal

To contribute to a stronger, more secure L2 ecosystem by identifying vulnerabilities and improving the safety of decentralized applications.
Our reports are designed to provide valuable insights for developers, teams, and users looking to build or engage with secure smart contracts for zkSync.

What We Offer:
- Free Audits: Free audits for the distinguished ZKsync community and ecosystem projects.
- Paid Audits: Comprehensive security audits for all other blockchain-related projects.
